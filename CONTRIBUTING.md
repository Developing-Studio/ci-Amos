# Contributing Guidelines

- No inappropriate contributions, this means:
  - Nothing hateful.
  - Nothing NSFW.
  - No generally unacceptable features for a bot in a public server.

- Use [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org)
  - If you don't do this, I will deny your PR without further inspection.

- No annoying features, such as anything that creates spam, especially if it DMs users.

- Unless there's a good reason not to, commands should be locked to the primary channel, you can see how to do this in cogs such as fun/ducks.
